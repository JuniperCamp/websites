      <h1>Naturism is a way of life in harmony with nature, the practice of communal nudity, and the encouragement of self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.</h1>
      <h2><em>However</em>, there are many different naturists in the world that live by their own definition.</h2>
      <p>Below are a few types of naturism. Many types intersect with one another. For example, ethical naturism typically coincides with family naturism.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Activist Naturism</em> utilizes the human body&mdash;not necessarily for naturism's natural qualities&mdash; to call attention to social ills and problems.</li>
        <li><em>Casual Naturism</em> is nudity without philosophy. Practicioners tend to like being naked without a deeper reason.</li>
        <li><em>Ethical Naturism</em> is the belief that accepting the human body by rejecting social stigmas and minimizing your impact on nature are moral, ethical, and spiritual imperatives. It is a philosophy that encompasses the entirety of a practioner's daily life&mdash;with or without clothes.</li>
        <li><em>Family Naturism</em> incorporates children and teenagers in an attempt to encourage body confidence and care for nature at an early age.</li>
        <li><em>Home Naturism</em> focuses on being naked and natural within the confines of a home whether alone or not.</li>
        <li><em>Outdoor Naturism</em> explores the world naked whether permissible or not, such as skinny dipping or hiking.</li>
        <li><em>Religious Naturism</em> weaves nudity and nature together within an existing religious context, such as the Digambara monks in Jainism.</li>
        <li><em>Sex-positive Naturism</em> accepts that humans are sexual by nature and that topics of sex be discussed without taboo.</li>
        <li><em>Sexual Naturism</em> treats nudity and naturalness as sexually explicit and for sexual satisfaction.</li>
        <li><em>Social Naturism</em> is when two or more individuals participate in an activity naked.</li>
      </ul>
